# Presentation
This project is a tutorial made by `Computer vision engeneer` with some modifications added.

# Modification:
For this tutorial, I used OpenCV image library processing, it's mostly the same functions as `sckiti-image` with some differences on data type reading.<br>
I also created a small web application using Streamlit and FastAPI where the user can choose the model and make prediction on different images.
